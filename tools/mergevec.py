File: mergevec.py 
Author: blake.w.wulfe@gmail.com 
Date: 6/13/2014
File Description:

	This file contains a function that merges .vec files called "merge_vec_files". 
	I made it as a replacement for mergevec.cpp (created by Naotoshi Seo. 
	See: http://note.sonots.com/SciSoftware/haartraining/mergevec.cpp.html) 
	in order to avoid recompiling openCV with mergevec.cpp. 

	To use the function:
	(1) Place all .vec files to be merged in a single directory (vec_directory).
	(2) Navigate to this file in your CLI (terminal or cmd) and type "python mergevec.py -v your_vec_directory -o your_output_filename".

		The first argument (-v) is the name of the directory containing the .vec files
		The second argument (-o) is the name of the output file

	To test the output of the function:
	(1) Install openCV.
	(2) Navigate to the output file in your CLI (terminal or cmd).
	(2) Type "opencv_createsamples -w img_width -h img_height -vec output_filename". 
		This should show the .vec files in sequence.
